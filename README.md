## Warning

This project is still in Beta, there will be a lot of bugs and possibly crashes. //build

## What is Salhack?
Salhack is a 1.12.2 open sourced client that got discontinued. This project is a continuation for the client for the latest version of minecraft and fabric.

## Baritone
Salhack does not include Baritone Integration as we do not want to wait for baritone to update for newer Minecraft versions everytime. Any bugs related to Baritone is not our problem. You can download baritone separately [here](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/releases).

## Installation

Salhack is a fabric mod for `1.20.1` and `1.20`. There are already pre build jar files on our [release page](https://github.com/CrytoPal/Continued-Salhack/releases). To use Salhack just download and drop the jar file in your mods folder and start fabric. Have fun!

If you want the latest dev build click [here](https://github.com/CrytoPal/Continued-Salhack/actions) and select the build, then download the artifact. Extract it from the zip and drop the jar file that doesn't have the `source` in it's name into your mods folder and start fabric. Have fun.

**Tip:** You can open the GUI with Right Shift (You can change that later.)

## Support

If you have a bug, please open an issue on github and put the Bug tag or contact us via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XmXJSBgQbD) server

If you want to suggest a feature, open an issue and put the Feature Tag.
